Snekui:
- Fix ai such that sneks target both mass and other sneks,
  instead of leading to a stalemate. (look at AISagar for reference)


Chrenchui:
- Make a basic tank that can move with wasd, whose gun rotates towards
  the mouse cursor.
- Create some sort of basic shooting.
- Create basics stats for a tank.
- Choose which tank classes we should make
- Decide how we are going to incorporate the classes into a BST.
- Make the tanks for each class using PShapes.
- Differentiate the shooting between the different classes.
- Incorporate upgrades to bullet speed, damage, regen etc.
- Create AIChrench's that can fight both the human and other AI's.
