plan/20170523:

SAGAR.UI currently has:
-player movement
-player/food consumption
-food spawning

SAGAR.UI still requires:
-AI movement
-splitting/merging of both player and AI
	-player splitting to be implemented first for the purpose of MVP
	-AI splitting to be implemented post-MVP, maybe only for certain difficulties (?)

Future updates:
-screen control (one of two methods)
	-center the ball and move the surroundings in accordance to the ball
	-fog out the entire screen except the small area that the ball is in (field of view)
-implement other UI games
	-snek
	-chrench
	-mar
	-war
